    <h1>Career Development</h1>
    <div class="card">
      <p>
        I am currently specializing in <strong>computer systems, architecture, and networks</strong>,
        with a strong academic interest in low-level systems, infrastructure, and the foundations
        that enable reliable and scalable computing.
      </p>

      <p>
        Beyond engineering practice, I aspire to pursue a <strong>PhD</strong>
        and build a long-term career in <strong>academia</strong>.
        My objective is to contribute to scientific research while engaging in
        <strong>university-level teaching</strong>,
        as I strongly believe in the role of education as a driver of inspiration,
        critical thinking, and intellectual growth.
      </p>

      <p>
        I am particularly motivated by research in computer science,
        where scientific work not only advances technology,
        but also makes knowledge, tools, and innovation
        <strong>accessible to a wider community</strong>.
        Through research and teaching, I aim to contribute to the
        <strong>greater good</strong> by supporting open knowledge,
        scientific rigor, and the transmission of expertise to future generations.
