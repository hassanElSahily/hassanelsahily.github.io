      <h2>Personal & Cultural Experience (PCE)</h2>

      <p>
        Through the Personal & Cultural Experience component of my studies,
        supported by sustained interaction with international environments,
        I strengthened my adaptability, intercultural communication skills,
        and capacity to integrate efficiently into new professional and cultural contexts.
      </p>

      <p>
        In particular, I completed the course
        <strong>Intercultural Management</strong> delivered by <strong>ESCP</strong>,
        which provided me with structured tools to analyze cultural differences,
        manage cross-cultural teams, and understand how cultural contexts influence
        decision-making and organizational behavior.
      </p>

      <p>
        I also followed the course
        <strong>Inclusive Leadership: The Power of Workplace Diversity</strong>
        offered by the <strong>University of Colorado</strong>,
        strengthening my understanding of inclusive leadership,
        unconscious bias, and the value of diversity in fostering innovation,
        collaboration, and sustainable team performance.
      </p>

      <p>
        Altogether, these experiences reinforced my <strong>adaptability</strong>,
        <strong>open-mindedness</strong>, and ability to collaborate effectively in
        <strong>multicultural and inclusive environments</strong>,
        essential competencies for an engineer operating in a global context.

      <h2>Second Foreign Language (LV2 — German)</h2>
      <p>
        I am currently studying <strong>German as a second foreign language (LV2)</strong>,
        motivated by its importance in the European engineering and industrial ecosystem.
      </p>
      <p>
        Learning German allows me to strengthen my <strong>linguistic versatility</strong>
        and prepares me for potential professional opportunities in
        <strong>international and cross-border environments</strong>,
        particularly within Europe.
