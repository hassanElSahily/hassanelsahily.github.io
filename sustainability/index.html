  <h1>Sustainability & Civic Engagement</h1>

  <div class="card ">
    <p>
      This section highlights my commitment to <strong>social responsibility</strong>,
      <strong>humanitarian engagement</strong>, and sustainable values.
      Beyond technical skills, I strongly believe that engineers have a role to play
      in supporting communities and contributing to collective well-being.

    <h2>Humanitarian Engagement — Red Cross Lebanon</h2>
    <p>
      From <strong>2021 to 2022</strong>, I was actively involved as a volunteer with the
      <strong>Lebanese Red Cross</strong>, where I contributed to humanitarian and civic actions
      in a challenging social and economic context.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Coordination of <strong>food distribution events</strong> for vulnerable populations.</li>
      <li>Participation in <strong>logistical organization</strong> and on-field operations.</li>
      <li>Awareness and educational activities with <strong>young people</strong>
          on life skills, solidarity, and civic values.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Building on this experience, I will be <strong>returning this summer</strong> to continue
      my engagement with the Lebanese Red Cross, reinforcing my long-term commitment to
      <strong>humanitarian action and civic responsibility. Which also validates my 30-40h of civic engagement</strong>.

    <h2>Values and Impact</h2>
    <p>
      These experiences strengthened my sense of <strong>responsibility</strong>,
      <strong>teamwork</strong>, and <strong>leadership</strong>, while reinforcing the importance
      of empathy and adaptability in complex environments.
    </p>
    <p>
      They also shape my vision of engineering as a discipline that should serve
      <strong>people, sustainability, and social progress</strong>.
