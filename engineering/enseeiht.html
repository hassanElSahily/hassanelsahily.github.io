        <!-- Intro -->
        <div class="card">
            <p>
                As part of my studies at <strong>ENSEEIHT</strong>,
                I am engaged in an engineering curriculum focused on
                <strong>computer systems, architecture, and networks</strong>.
                This training emphasizes both theoretical foundations
                and hands-on projects addressing low-level systems,
                communication infrastructures, and performance constraints.

            <h2>Computer Architecture & Digital Design (Archi) - On going</h2>

            <p>
                The <strong>Archi</strong> project focused on the design and implementation
                of a simplified <strong>UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter)</strong>
                using <strong>VHDL</strong>, targeting a hardware-level understanding
                of serial communication interfaces.
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Design of a modular UART architecture (TX, RX, clock, and control units).</li>
                <li>Implementation of asynchronous serial transmission (RS232 format).</li>
                <li>Clock division and timing control for transmission and reception.</li>
                <li>Management of control registers, interrupts, and transmission errors.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                This project provides hands-on experience with
                hardware description languages, finite state machines,
                and the interaction between hardware components and processor-level control.

            <h2>Interconnection of Autonomous Systems (Interco) - On going</h2>

            <p>
                The <strong>Interco</strong> project focuses on the design and deployment
                of an <strong>autonomous system (AS)</strong> providing network services
                to both enterprise and residential clients,
                as well as its interconnection with other autonomous systems.
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Design and implementation of an autonomous system using
                    <strong>dynamic routing (OSPF)</strong>.
                </li>
                <li>IP addressing plan based on an assigned address block
                    and hierarchical allocation to clients.</li>
                <li>Deployment of enterprise networks distributed over
                    <strong>two sites</strong> connected through different AS.
                </li>
                <li>Configuration of secure inter-site communication
                    using <strong>VPN mechanisms</strong>.</li>
                <li>Initial implementation of <strong>Quality of Service (QoS)</strong>
                    for enterprise traffic (work in progress).</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                This project provides a concrete understanding of
                large-scale network design, routing protocols,
                and the interaction between service providers,
                enterprise networks, and end users.

        <!-- Compilation & Language Processing (TDL) -->
        <div class="card">
            <h2>Compilation & Language Processing - On going</h2>

            <p>
                This project focused on the design and implementation
                of a compilation chain for a domain-specific language,
                emphasizing the transformation from high-level code
                to low-level executable representations.
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Lexical and syntactic analysis using formal grammars.</li>
                <li>Construction and traversal of abstract syntax trees (AST).</li>
                <li>Semantic checks and symbol table management.</li>
                <li>Code generation targeting a low-level or intermediate representation.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                This project strengthened my understanding of
                compiler architecture, language semantics,
                and the close relationship between programming languages
                and system-level execution.

            <h2>Academic Perspective</h2>
            <p>
                The ENSEEIHT curriculum plays a central role in shaping my
                long-term academic objectives.
                Through these projects, I developed a strong interest in
                <strong>systems research</strong>,
                supported by the diversity of courses ranging from
                Internet architecture and networking fundamentals
                to local area networks, telecommunications,
                and operating system architecture.
            </p>


            <p>
                This experience directly supports my ambition to pursue a
                <strong>PhD</strong> and contribute to research and teaching
                in computer science, with a focus on
                rigorous system design and knowledge transmission.
