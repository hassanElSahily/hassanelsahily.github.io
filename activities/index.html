  <div class="card">
    <p>
      Beyond my academic and technical path, I place great importance on activities
      that nourish curiosity, creativity, and personal balance.
      Traveling and hiking play a central role in this approach,
      allowing me to discover new places, landscapes, cultures,
      and perspectives through direct experience.
    </p>

    <p>
      I am also deeply interested in writing, particularly poetry and journalistic-style texts,
      which I use as ways to observe the world, reflect on experiences,
      and express ideas with clarity and sensitivity.
